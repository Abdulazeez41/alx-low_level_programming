### 0x14-bit_manipulation

```text
Bit manipulation is a technique in computer programming where individual bits in a data structure (e.g., integers, characters, or arrays) are directly modified or examined to achieve a specific purpose. It involves using bitwise operators (such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift operators) to perform various operations at the bit level.

Bit manipulation is particularly useful when dealing with low-level programming, embedded systems, data compression, cryptography, and other applications where memory and performance are critical.

Common bit manipulation operations include:

1. Setting a bit: Turning on a specific bit in a binary number while keeping other bits unchanged.
2. Clearing a bit: Turning off a specific bit in a binary number while keeping other bits unchanged.
3. Toggling a bit: Flipping the value of a specific bit (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) while keeping other bits unchanged.
4. Checking a bit: Determining the value of a specific bit in a binary number.
5. Shifting bits: Moving the bits left or right to perform multiplication or division by powers of 2.
6. Masking: Selecting specific bits in a binary number using bitwise AND and OR operations.

Bit manipulation allows programmers to optimize memory usage, improve code efficiency, and implement complex algorithms more effectively by performing operations directly on individual bits instead of using traditional arithmetic or logical operations on entire data structures. However, it requires careful understanding and handling of bitwise operators and the underlying binary representation of data.
